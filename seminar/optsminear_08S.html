<td><span class="InGreyCell"> Abstract: I will present a corrector-predictor method for solving sufficient
linear complementarity problems (LCP) with an infeasible starting point. The
method generates a sequence of iterates in an $l_2$-neighborhood of the
infeasible central path of the LCP without depending on the handicap
$\kappa$ of the problem, so it may be used for any sufficient linear
complementarity problem. Our algorithm has the best known iteration
complexity if the starting point is feasible or close to be feasible and
also if our starting point is "big enough". Moreover, our algorithm is
superlinearly convergent even for degenerate problems. More precisely, by
using a predictor with order $m>1$, we show that the duality gap converges
to zero with Q-order $m+1$ in the nondegenerate case, and with Q-order
$(m+1)/2$ in the degenerate case. Some numerical results are given to
demonstrate this method's effectiveness.

<td><span class="InGreyCell"> Abstract: This talk is the first part of a series of two talks on global long-time behaviors of constrained affine dynamics, motivated by recent work on piecewise affine systems (PASs) and reachability analysis of linear/affine dynamics. We will start with a brief review of local and
finite-time switching properties of (Lispchitz continuous) PASs, for
example, non-Zenoness and simple switching behavior, and discuss their
applications to dynamical complementarity systems. We then focus on global
long-time switching behaviors of PASs. We show that the positively invariant
set associated with each affine dynamics plays an important role in
characterization of various global switching dynamics of PASs. We will
discuss certain properties of positively invariant sets and their
implications to PASs and reachability analysis.

<td><span class="InGreyCell"> Abstract: In this talk we present some inertia theorems in Euclidean Jordan algebras. First, based on the continuity of eigenvalues, we give an alternate proof of Kaneyuki's generalization of
Sylvester's law of inertia in simple Euclidean Jordan algebras. As a
consequence, we show that the cone spectrum of any quadratic representation
with respect to a symmetric cone is finite. Second, we present
Ostrowski-Schneider type inertia results in Euclidean Jordan algebras. In
particular, we relate the inertias of objects $a$ and $x$ in a Euclidean
Jordan algebra when $L_a(x)>0$ or $S_a(x)>0$, where $L_a$ and $S_a$ denote
Lyapunov and Stein transformations respectively.
