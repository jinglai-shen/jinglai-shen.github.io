<td><span class="InGreyCell"> Abstract: A cone K is called homogeneous if for any two points x and y in K
 there exists a non-degenerate linear automorphism A of K (i.e. AK=K) such
 that Ax=y. Vinberg partially classified these cones in terms of
 T-algebras.
 He proved that each homogeneous cone is isomorphic to a cone of
 generalized
 positive-definite Hermitian matrices. In the talk, we will present
 key results that lead to this classification. Time permitting, we will
 also discuss self-concordant barriers for homogeneous cones. </span></td>

Hilbert space $H$ and $K$ be a closed convex cone with dual $K^*$ in
$H$. The cone spectrum of $L$ relative to $K$ is the set of all
$\lambda \in R$ for which the linear complementarity problem
$$x \in K,\ y=L(x)-\lambda x \in K^{*},\,\mbox{and}\,\, \langle x,
y\rangle=0 $$ admits a nonzero solution $x\in H$. In the setting of a
Euclidean Jordan algebra $H$ and the corresponding symmetric cone $K$, we
discuss the finiteness of the cone spectrum for ${\bf Z}$-transformations
and quadratic representations on $H$. </span></td>

<td><span class="InGreyCell"> Abstract: I will talk about my recent result on stability analysis for linear complementarity systems (LCSs). Specifically, we show that asymptotic stability of an LCS is equivalent to its exponential 
stability. The cornerstone of the proof relies on the concepts of uniform 
asymptotic stability and positive homogeneity of the LCS, where the former 
is closely related to continuous solution dependence on initial conditions. 
We show the stability equivalence for both Lipschitz and non-Lipschitz 
LCSs. For the latter systems, the upper Lipschitz property of the LCP and 
differential inclusion formulation of the LCS is utilized. Finally, we 
will discuss Lyapunov stability of the (Lipschitz) LCSs satisfying 
B-singleton property from the conewise linear perspective. This 
perspective leads to simpler argument for the stability results.
