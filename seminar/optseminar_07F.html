<td><span class="InGreyCell"> Abstract: A convex body K is a compact convex set in $R^n$ which has an interior.
It is known that K has a unique circumscribed ellipsoid MVCE(K) and a unique
inscribed ellipsoid MVIE(K).  The former contains K and has minimum volume, and
the latter is contained in K and has maximum volume.
The two ellipsoids crop up in many different fields under different
disguises.

In this talk, we first develop the basic properties the the ellipsoids using
semi-infinite programming.  The uniqueness of the ellipsoids have the important
property that they inherit the symmetry poperties of K.
The seond part of the talk will be about the symmetry properties convex
bodies and ellipsoids.

continuous) for which the continuous dynamics model quasilinear

system.  After commenting on the modelling, we show the well-
posedness of the system (with switching as data), existence of
an optimal control, and "hybrid well-posedness" of a feedback
implementation. </span></td>

<td><span class="InGreyCell"> Abstract: I will talk about my recent result on stability analysis for linear complementarity systems (LCSs). Specifically, we show that asymptotic stability of an LCS is equivalent to its exponential 
stability. The cornerstone of the proof relies on the concepts of uniform 
asymptotic stability and positive homogeneity of the LCS, where the former 
is closely related to continuous solution dependence on initial conditions. 
We show the stability equivalence for both Lipschitz and non-Lipschitz 
LCSs. For the latter systems, the upper Lipschitz property of the LCP and 
differential inclusion formulation of the LCS is utilized. Finally, we 
will discuss Lyapunov stability of the (Lipschitz) LCSs satisfying 
B-singleton property from the conewise linear perspective. This 
perspective leads to simpler argument for the stability results.
